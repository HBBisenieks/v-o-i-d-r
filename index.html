					<h3>What the <i>hell,</i> Richard?</h3>
					<p>
						Look. I commit to the bit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok, but to spell it out a bit more: I made a joke on Mastodon, to whit:
					</p>
					<p>
						"my new social network will take your status updates and pipe them Directly to /dev/null <br/>angel investors, call me"
					</p>
					<p>
						and then things got a little out of hand. Friends egged me on. Lord forgive me, but I was fully on my behavior.
					</p>
					<h3>Ok, but what the hell am I looking at?</h3>
					<p>
						v o i d r  is the only social network that takes the idea of screaming into the void seriously. No followers, no trending topics, 
						no bullshit. Type out your status (with no character limits!), hit the "Scream" button, and watch your words fade gracefully away 
						into the void before being deleted.
					</p>
					<h3>Alright, bozo, who the fuck are you, though?</h3>
					<p>
						I'm author, podcaster, and general nuisance <a href="https://hilarybisenieks.com">Hilary B. Bisenieks</a>. Since 2019, I've been 
						the host of <a href="http://trunkcast.com">Tales from the Trunk: Reading the Stories that Didn't Made It</a>, a podcast about 
						the writing life, which features conversations with and readings from a diverse mix of established and up-and-coming science fiction, 
						fantasy, horror, and other genre authors.
					</p>
					<h3>Ok, but really, y tho?</h3>
					<p>
						Am I not permitted to have fun?
