The ultimate social network: write a post and watch it fade away into oblivion.

Created as a [joke on Mastodon](https://wandering.shop/@HBBisenieks/109474511388036692), implemented because you *commit* to the bit.

Still to do:
- [x] Keep the void from overflowing into the left column if your shout is too long
- [x] Move the uwu/OWO selector ~~to a collabsible menu~~
- [ ] Move the OWO/uwu selector to a collabsible menu
- [ ] Make an about page/modal
- [x] Fix font-size stuff
- [ ] Docker-compose file for folks who want to run their own in a container???
